# AOGNets: Compositional Grammatical Architectures for Deep Learning

This project provides source code for our CVPR19 paper [AOGNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05847).
The code is still under refactoring. Please stay tuned.

## Installation

### Requirements

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (although not tested yet, other OS should work too if PyTorch can be installed successfully)

Python 3 ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is recommended)

CUDA 9 or newer

PyTorch 0.4 or newer

NVIDIA [APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex)

NVIDIA [NCCL](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-install-guide/index.html).

### Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/iVMCL/AOGNets.git
$ cd AOGNets
$ pip install requirements.txt
```

### Some tweaks

USE pillow-simd to speed up pytorch image loader (assume Anaconda is used)

```
$ pip uninstall pillow
$ conda uninstall --force jpeg libtiff -y
$ conda install -c conda-forge libjpeg-turbo
$ CC="cc -mavx2" pip install --no-cache-dir -U --force-reinstall --no-binary :all: --compile pillow-simd
```

## ImageNet dataset preparation

- Download the ImageNet dataset to YOUR_IMAGENET_PATH and move validation images to labeled subfolders
    - The [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soumith/imagenetloader.torch/master/valprep.sh) may be helpful.

- Create a datasets subfolder under your cloned AOGNets and a symlink to the ImageNet dataset

```
$ cd AOGNets
$ mkdir datasets
$ ln -s PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGENET ./datasets/
```

## Perform training on ImageNet dataset

NVIDIA Apex is used for FP16 training.

E.g.,

```
$ cd AOGNets
$ ./examples/train_fp16.sh aognet_s configs/aognet_imagenet_12M.yaml first_try
```

See more configuration files in AOGNets/configs. Change the GPU settings in train_fp16.sh


## Perform testing with pretrained models

- Pretrained [AOGNet_12M in ImageNet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MTPFR8C9tCXFNeYgn9NqZ3wOJt8ZeMm7) on Google Drive

- Pretrained [AOGNet_40M in ImageNet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t7gGiNcP8L6TSzLDHg8qcb8G_x-nlIfV) on Google Drive

- More coming soon

- Remarks: The provided pretrained models are obtained using the latest refactored code and the performance are slightly different from the results in the paper.

E.g.,

```
$ cd AOGNets
$ ./examples/test_fp16.sh aognet_s AOGNet_12M_PATH
```
